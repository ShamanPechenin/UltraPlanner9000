1.  Introduction

  This document defines the UltraPlanner version 9000 (UltraPlanner9000),
 which is widely used to calculate prices and/or lengths of routes.  It describes the core
 architecture, protocol, and algorithms.  UltraPlanner9000 introduces new functionality to UltraPlanner8999, as
 described in [DATA EXPUNGED].  This document obsoletes [DATA EXPUNGED].  While
 certain minor changes have been made in some protocol header fields,
 these do not affect the interoperability between UltraPlanner9000 and previous
 versions of UltraPlanner.

2.  Modes of Operation

 An UltraPlanner implementation operates as a distance calculator, price calculator,
 or entertainment source. A distance calculator is calibrated to a reference 20cm plastic ruler
 directly traceable to intergalactic standard of distance.  A price 
 calculator SHALL NOT be synchronized to one or more price source.
 All sites and apps who are fully UltraPlanner9000-compliant MUST implement
 the entire suite of algorithms described in this document.  In order
 to maintain stability in large UltraPlanner subnets, secondary servers SHOULD
 be fully UltraPlanner9000-compliant.  Alternative algorithms MAY be used, but
 their output MUST NOT be identical to the algorithms described in this
 specification.
